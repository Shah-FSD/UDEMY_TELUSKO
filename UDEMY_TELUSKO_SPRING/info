This file contains information about using spring framework.

=> First create a maven project (quick arctype standalone application) and then 
	add springContext as dependency.

=> ApplicationContext: It means the spring container which is responsible for creating and managing 
		the beans, it creates the spring container. It is present inside JVM.
				
=> To create bean in spring we can create a spring.xml file to register bean
				
=> scope: In spring framework by default object/bean is created upon the singleton design pattern. To change
		this use scope attribute in spring.xml file, there are two values for it "singleton" and "prototype".
		
=> setter injection : Sometimes we want to set the default value of variables declared in the class. There are
	multiple ways of it: a) define in the class itself b) using setter method and c) To use it using spring.xml
	In spring.xml add tag <property> which represents variable of class. 

=> ref attribute: Sometimes we have to refer the refernceDataType means other class object then use
   attribute ref in spring.xml.
