Collections Framework, which is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a way to
work with and manipulate groups of objects. The Collections Framework is part of the Java Standard Library
and is widely used in Java applications for managing and organizing data.

Here are some key aspects of the Java Collections Framework:

Interfaces: The framework includes a set of core interfaces, such as List, Set, and Map, 
			that define common behaviors and operations for collections. 
			These interfaces serve as blueprints for implementing different types of collections.

Classes: Java provides various classes that implement the core interfaces. 
	     For example, ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface, 
	     HashSet and TreeSet implement the Set interface, and HashMap and TreeMap implement the Map interface.

Generics: Generics are used extensively in the Collections Framework to provide type safety. 
		  This allows you to specify the type of elements that a collection can hold, 
		  and it helps prevent runtime errors.

Common Operations: The framework defines common operations for working with collections, 
					including adding and removing elements, searching for elements, iterating over elements, and sorting.

Iterators: Collections provide iterators, which allow you to traverse and manipulate the elements
		   in a collection in a consistent and efficient manner.

Concurrency: Java provides collections that are suitable for multi-threaded applications, 
			 such as ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList, to handle concurrent access.

Here are some commonly used interfaces and classes in the Java Collections Framework:

List: Ordered collection of elements that allows duplicates. Implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

Set: Unordered collection of unique elements. Implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Map: Key-value pairs where keys are unique. Implementations include HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

Queue: Ordered collection typically used for holding elements before processing. Implementations include LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

Deque: Double-ended queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends. Implemented by ArrayDeque and LinkedList.
